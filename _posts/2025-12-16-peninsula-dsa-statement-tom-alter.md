Peninsula DSA is deeply proud of its connections with AFT 1493, and counts many professional teachers as valued comrades in our organization and even on our steering committee. This connection adds to our collective horror and ire at recent attacks on academic freedom [[1](#1)] and the all out assault [[2](#2)] on both students and teachers by this fascist government [[3](#3)], that nonetheless heighten existing contradictions and problems in higher education [[4](#4)].

Online harassment of educators, in particular, is on the rise, often with the explicit goal of getting people fired from their jobs [[5](#5)]. For years now, reactionary vigilantes on the internet have made it their life’s work to “expose” regular school teachers, perhaps because they express ideas with which they find dangerous to their preferred social structure, or perhaps because the person is of an appearance that they find similarly distasteful (such as being an openly queer person).

One recent case in particular has caused us great concern [[6](#6)]. On September 10, Tom Alter, a tenured professor of history at Texas State University, was fired without due process, after speaking in a personal capacity at an online socialist conference. His comments were clipped and highlighted by a self-described online “fascist” [[7](#7)] who began a viral campaign to get Prof. Alter fired. 

As socialists  with a particular solidarity with working teachers, we are deeply concerned by this case and the precedent it sets. Professor Alter is a comrade in our struggle for socialism, and since his firing was due to his politics, it sets a very bad precedent for socialists nationwide. To put it bluntly: an attack against one of us is an attack against all of us, in every sense of the phrase.

As a chapter, we strongly support the First Amendment right to free speech, as well as job protections against illegal firing. This case is about the right of socialists to teach and to exist in public in this society, as well as defending the rights of all working people. Peninsula DSA remains committed to its support of teachers' unions, and to general academic and intellectual freedom, and we proudly add our name to the list of organizations nationwide supporting the Committee to Defend Tom Alter. States away we may be, but our struggles are alike.


**Reinstate Comrade Alter now!**
