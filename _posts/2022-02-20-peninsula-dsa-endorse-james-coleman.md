Peninsula DSA Endorses James Coleman for CA State Assembly (AD 21)

On February 20, 2022, members of Peninsula DSA (PDSA) voted to enthusiastically
endorse PDSA member [James Coleman](https://james4california.com/) in his grassroots, corporate-free campaign for
California State Assembly in newly redrawn District 21, which now represents eastern
San Mateo County from Brisbane and South San Francisco down to East Palo Alto.
Because James favors bold, uncompromising action to effect popular progressive
policies such as raising the minimum wage, instituting higher taxes on the ultra wealthy,
and increasing spending on health care, education, and infrastructure, he is the best
candidate to bring about transformative change for working people on the Peninsula,
and he is well positioned to win the primary election in June 2022.
In 2020, James successfully ran as a Democratic Socialist against 18-year incumbent
and mayor Richard Garbarino, winning a city council seat in his hometown of South San
Francisco with over 52 percent of the votes. As South San Francisco’s first openly
LGBTQ+ and youngest-ever City Councilmember, James has a track record of looking
out for the interests of the working class. So far he has been instrumental in 

1. building broad support for the Early Care and Education for All South San
Francisco ballot measure campaign (modeled after Portland DSA’s successful
measure in Multnomah County, OR) to bring universal preschool to all working
families in South City;
2. passing a citywide Medicare for All resolution, which helped secure outgoing CA
Assemblymember Kevin Mullin’s commitment to vote Yes on CalCare (AB 1400);
and
3. advocating for union-constructed multi-family housing—including mixed-income
social housing—to solve the dual crises of decreased housing stock and
increased numbers of unhoused neighbors on the Peninsula.

In addition to organizing with PDSA, James was actively involved in Harvard College
Students for Bernie Sanders, and in spring 2020 helped transition the group to a Young
DSA chapter (Harvard Young DSA). A proponent of bold action on climate, James has
also been involved with the Alliance for Climate Education, the Harvard Undergraduates
for Environmental Justice, and Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard.
James Coleman has also earned the endorsements of SEIU California, the San
Francisco Berniecrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Courage to Change PAC, Daybreak
PAC, Project Super Bloom, Reach Coalition (allyship), Downballot Progress, Run for
Something, and current DSA-endorsed elected officials: CA Assemblymember Alex Lee
(AD 25), Redwood City Councilmember Lissette Espinoza-Garnica, and San Francisco
Supervisor Dean Preston.
