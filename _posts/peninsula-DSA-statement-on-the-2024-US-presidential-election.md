<h3>Peninsula DSA Statement on the 2024 US Presidential Election</h3>

Democratic socialists know that governments that [protect the interests of the ruling class](https://www.vox.com/2014/4/18/5624310/martin-gilens-testing-theories-of-american-politics-explained) while refusing to guarantee our rights to housing, healthcare, and education are democracies only in name, and that both major parties in fact support a dictatorship of the [bourgeoisie](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/b/o.htm#bourgeoisie) (that is, the one percent). Even so, DSA engages with the electoral process as candidates, campaigners, canvassers, and voters. The electoral arena is often where we find allies, grow coalitions, and inspire the rest of the working class to build socialism together, brick by brick.

This election, we are faced with a stark reality that the duopoly power shared by the two major US parties is a [ratchet effect](https://stopmebeforeivoteagain.org/stopme/chapter02.html), dragging the window of political discourse ever rightward, despite the broad popularity of progressive policy. As socialists, we understand the [Purpose of a System is What It Does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does), and in an election in which [progressive policies](https://missouriindependent.com/2024/11/05/missourians-vote-to-increase-minimum-wage-require-paid-sick-leave/) and down-ballot candidates consistently outperformed the top of the ticket, it is clear that the Democratic Party is more concerned with excising social democratic and “Berniecrat” elements from the party and providing unwavering material support for Israeli genocide than winning “the most important election of our lifetimes.” To be clear, the Democratic corporate consultant class will get paid either way, and the stock portfolios of Democratic and Republican politicians alike will continue to go up.

The bourgeois election process may have selected the American version of fascism embodied in Donald Trump, but we recognize two important facts. One, American fascism is neither recent nor novel, with a long, brutal history both domestically and internationally supported by both parties. Two, as proven in places like Indonesia and Chile, democratic socialist policies are broadly popular and effective at countering reactionary politics, at least until the forces of US capital intervene on the side of violent, anti-democratic repression. As Americans worry about the very real threat of violent, anti-democratic repression at home (an ongoing and longstanding reality for many Americans, and a new possibility for certain privileged groups), it is worth reminding ourselves that the tools of imperial control [perfected abroad](https://blowback.show/) will inevitably come home and be used on us too.

<h4>What Is to Be Done?</h4>

The question is the same as it was a hundred years ago: Will we collectively choose [Socialism or Barbarism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm)? American support of Israel’s brutal genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza, mirrored by the brutal militarization at our southern border, shows that the American ruling elite have made their choice: barbarism. Therefore, we must organize together to build a future worth passing on to the next generation. We must be sober, analytical, and adaptable. We must look to the analysis and lessons learned from those that came before us. We must help educate each other.

We are in the midst of a multi-generational class war, as well as a time of many m[orbid symptoms as the old world dies and the new world struggles to be born](https://inthesetimes.com/article/freedom-grief-healing-death-liberation-movements). What that new world will look like remains to be seen, but in the words of the late, great David Graeber, “The ultimate hidden truth of the world is that it is something we make, and could just as easily make differently.”
