<h4>Socialists oppose all forms of colonialism, imperialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. ***Palestine cannot be an exception!***</h4>

On April 27, 2025, Peninsula Democratic Socialists of America (Peninsula DSA) unanimously [adopted a resolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6lLPSJAHtTyJRWRAyjmeqP4-75Fa-twR-AhLJBKKKk/edit?tab=t.0) affirming our chapter’s anti-zionist stance in both principle and practice. Following the leadership of chapters like [Silicon Valley](https://siliconvalleydsa.org/2024/10/23/anti-zionist-resolution/), [Seattle](https://seattledsa.org/2024/08/reaffirming-our-anti-zionist-commitments/), [Twin Cities](https://twincitiesdsa.org/2025/02/twin-cities-dsas-anti-zionist-resolution-an-important-step-towards-palestinian-liberation/), [Las Vegas](https://lvdsa.org/2024/09/06/las-vegas-dsa-passes-resolution-for-an-anti-zionist-lvdsa-in-both-principle-and-practice/), [San Francisco](https://dsasf.org/dsa-sf-passes-anti-zionist-resolution/), [San Diego](asandiego.org/dsa-san-diego-passes-anti-zionist-resolution/), [Colorado Springs](https://www.cosdsa.org/blog/statement-re-cos-dsa-passes-a-resolution-for-an-anti-zionist-colorado-springs-dsa-in-both-principle-and-practice), [Inland Empire](https://www.iedsa.org/statement/resolution-for-anti-zionist-inland-empire-dsa/), [Boston](https://bostondsa.org/2022/01/21/boston-dsa-statement-on-new-bds-resolutions-and-dissent-from-the-npc/), [Philadelphia](https://www.phillydsa.org/resosandreports), [Austin](https://redfault.com/austin-socialist-news-bulletin-march-2024/), [Tidewater](https://x.com/palyouthmvmt/status/1817328403953148333), [Greater Baltimore](https://www.baltimoredsa.org/), [Houston](https://houstondsa.org/category/resolutions/), [Connecticut](https://ctdsa.org/palestine-organizing-in-connecticut-reflecting-on-ceasefire-resolutions/), [Boise](https://x.com/palyouthmvmt/status/1817328403953148333), [New Orleans](https://x.com/palyouthmvmt/status/1817328403953148333), [Northwest Ohio](https://x.com/palyouthmvmt/status/1817328403953148333), [Salt Lake City](https://saltlakedsa.org/2024/02/23/resolution-for-an-anti-zionist-salt-lake-dsa/amp/), [NEPA](https://www.nepadsa.org/stat-antizio), [Tampa](https://www.tampadsa.org/about-us/tampa-dsa-chapter-resolutions/), [Denver](https://denverdsa.wordpress.com/2023/10/14/denver-dsa-stands-with-palestine/), [Long Beach](https://www.instagram.com/dsa_lb/p/C20lOTTv9Ow/?locale=fr&hl=en), [North Texas](https://x.com/DSA_NorthTexas/status/1840584846927687942), [Spokane](https://x.com/palyouthmvmt/status/1817328403953148333), [Syracuse](https://x.com/palyouthmvmt/status/1817328403953148333), [Orange County](https://x.com/palyouthmvmt/status/1817328403953148333), [Tacoma](https://x.com/palyouthmvmt/status/1817328403953148333), [North New Jersey](https://north.dsanj.org/palestine/), [Champaign Urbana](https://x.com/chambanadsa), [Orlando](https://orlando.chapters.dsausa.org/statements/statement-on-an-anti-zionist-orlando-dsa-in-both-principle-and-praxis/), [Greater Lafayette](https://www.instagram.com/greaterlafayettedsa/p/C_T3TOwSawe/?next=/avaferferii/feed/&locale=en_US,en_US), and others, we join a growing movement within DSA standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people and their struggle for liberation.

Zionism is a [settler-colonial](https://books.google.com/books?id=xXlwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover) ideology that has enabled the [violent displacement](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/5/23/the-nakba-did-not-start-or-end-in-1948), dispossession, and oppression of Palestinians for over 75 years. Today, the Zionist project continues through an [ongoing genocide](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/) against Palestinians, particularly in Gaza and the West Bank, carried out with the full [financial, military, and political backing](https://truthout.org/articles/decades-of-us-arms-deals-with-israel-paved-the-way-to-genocide-in-gaza/) of the United States. Israeli forces have bombed [hospitals](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/12/pattern-israeli-attacks-gaza-hospitals-raises-grave-concerns-report), [schools](https://theintercept.com/2024/10/06/israel-bombing-schools-children-gaza-education/), [refugee camps](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-seeks-erase-refugee-camps-jenin-and-tulkarm), [homes](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/4/6/at-least-46-people-have-been-killed-in-israeli-attacks-on-gaza-over-the-la), and [entire neighborhoods](https://truthout.org/articles/report-israel-leveled-entire-blocks-in-gaza-when-unable-to-locate-target/), targeting civilians and vital infrastructure. They have imposed [mass starvation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/04/09/gaza-israels-imposed-starvation-deadly-children) as a weapon of war, destroyed Gaza’s universities and cultural institutions, and deliberately cut off food, water, medicine, and electricity to millions. As socialists, we oppose all forms of colonialism, imperialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. Our commitment to international solidarity demands that we reject Zionism in all its forms and actively work to dismantle systems of [apartheid](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution), ethnic cleansing, military occupation, and settler colonialism.

We affirm that opposing Zionism is not antisemitic. Peninsula DSA stands firmly against antisemitism and all forms of racism and bigotry. We recognize that many Jewish comrades — within DSA and beyond — are leading voices in the fight against Zionism and in the struggle for the liberation of all oppressed peoples.
Peninsula DSA reaffirms our solidarity with the Palestinian people and upholds the full right of return for all Palestinian refugees. We oppose the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and reject any framework that denies Palestinians their full human rights, freedom, and sovereignty.

We expect our Anti-Zionist resolution will make us an even stronger ally in the struggle for a free Palestine, and commend the work of several local organizations and coalitions fighting towards this end, including:

* [Palestinian Youth Movement](https://www.instagram.com/bayareapym/) (PYM)
* [Arab Resource & Organizing Center (AROC)](https://www.instagram.com/aroc_bayarea/)
* [Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP)](https://www.instagram.com/jvpbayarea/)
* [CA15forPalestine](https://www.instagram.com/ca15_for_palestine/)
* [Vigil4Gaza](https://www.instagram.com/vigil4gaza/)
* [Stanford Against Apartheid in Palestine (SAAP)](https://www.instagram.com/sit_in_to_stop_genocide/)

We look forward to working more closely with our allies, who have made it clear that DSA National must explicitly connect the fight against Zionism with our socialist and anti-colonialist principles.

We call on DSA chapters and the national organization to take a clear, principled Anti-Zionist position, and to help build an internationalist, anti-colonial, and anti-racist socialist movement.

A better world is possible — a world without colonialism, apartheid, or genocide.

Free Palestine.
