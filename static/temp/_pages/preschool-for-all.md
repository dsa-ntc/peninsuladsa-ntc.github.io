Peninsula DSAâ€™s Preschool for All working group is working toward the success of the Early Care and Education for All South San Francisco [ECE 4 All SSF](http://ece4allssf.org/) campaign to bring high-quality, full-time preschool to all children aged 2.5 to 5 years old whose families live or work in South City.

On June 3, 2022, our coalition rallied at City Hall to turn in the 5800+ voter signatures our grassroots volunteers gathered from mid-January through May. We are currently awaiting confirmation that our citizensâ€™ initiative has qualified for the November 8th ballot.
