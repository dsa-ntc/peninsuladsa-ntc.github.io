HOW TO ATTEND

* *In-person events:* If our public calendar (see above) lists a location, feel free to show up! Please RSVP if the option is available.
* *Virtual event:* You will need access to Peninsula DSA's private Discord server, which is limited to DSA members and vetted comrades. [Join PDSA](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/), or reach out the Steering Committee for more information at info@peninsuladsa.org

**Note:** Many PDSA events continue to be virtual in order to be more accessible to our geographically dispersed membership and to protect our most vulnerable comrades from respiratory illnesses such as flu and COVID.
