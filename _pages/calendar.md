Though Peninsula DSAâ€™s regular events are designed for our members, everyone interested in building working-class power on the Peninsula is welcome to attend. 

Note: in the interest of protecting our most vulnerable comrades from COVID, the majority of our events continue to be virtual, or else outdoors with ample air flow.
