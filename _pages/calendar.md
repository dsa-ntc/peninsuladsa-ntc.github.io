**Note:** In the interest of protecting our most vulnerable comrades from COVID, the majority of our events continue to be virtual. In-person events either take place outdoors with good air flow or require a same-day negative COVID rapid test.

<h3>Regular meetings</h3>
Get started with Peninsula DSA by attending one of our regular meetings!

* Chapter meetings are held on the 3rd Sunday of the month at 4-6pm.
* Working groups have their own meeting schedules: [Preschool for All](../preschool-for-all/), [Healthcare Justice](../healthcare-justice/), and [Ecosocialism](../ecosocialism/).
* [Reading group](../reading-group) meets at least once a month, usually on Saturdays at 6pm.
