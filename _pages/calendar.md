Peninsula DSAâ€™s meetings and events are designed for our members, though everyone interested in building working-class power on the Peninsula is welcome to attend. **Note:** In the interest of protecting our most vulnerable comrades from COVID, the majority of our events continue to be virtual. In-person events either take place outdoors with good air flow or require a same-day negative COVID rapid test.

Meetings
=======
The best way to get started with Peninsula DSA is to attend one of our regular meetings!

* **Chapter meetings** are held on the 3rd Sunday of the month at 4-6pm.
* * [**Reading group**](../reading-group) meets at least once a month, usually on Saturdays at 6:00pm.
* **Working groups** each have their own meeting schedule.
- [Preschool for All](../preschool-for-all/) (Yes on Measure DD) is every Tuesday at 5:30pm.
- [Healthcare Justice](../healthcare-justice/) meets about every 3 weeks, usually on a Wednesday or Thursday at 6:00pm.
- [Ecosocialism](../ecosocialism/) meets as needed.
