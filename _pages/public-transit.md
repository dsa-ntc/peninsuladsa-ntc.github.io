<h2>San Mateo County: Transit 4 All</h2>

<h3>:rotating_light: Push SamTrans to Support a Progressive Regional Funding Measure</h3>

<h4>:warning: BART & Caltrain are in trouble!</h4>

Did you know [BART](https://www.bart.gov/about/financials/crisis), [Caltrain](https://www.caltrain.com/blog/2023/04/financial-future-caltrain), and [SF Muni](https://www.sfmta.com/project-updates/sfmtas-financial-crisis) are facing "fiscal cliffs" that will force [massive service cuts](https://twitter.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=081245b4dc5f18f3a07fa71e2&id=326a2360be&e=ab29f1143c) if they don't find new funding? The proposed service cuts would mean disaster for transit riders all around the Bay Area:

* BART: No more night or weekend service!
* Caltrain: Back to just _one_ local train per hour!
* Muni: Goodbye to cable cars!
* SamTrans: No more free transfers---cutting off San Mateo County from the rest of the Bay!

<h4>:warning: SamTrans can help save regional transit...</h4>

Our county’s transit agency, [SamTrans](http://samtrans.com/), has the option to participate in a [five-county regional funding ballot measure](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/03/plan-to-raise-500-million-in-annual-sales-taxes-for-beleaguered-bay-area-transit-advances-in-legislature/) (Senators Weiner & Arreguín's [SB 63](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB63)). If voters approve the measure in November 2026, we'll save our transit agencies AND prevent fossil-fuel emissions by keeping cars off the road.

But some members of the [SamTrans Board of Directors](https://www.samtrans.com/about-samtrans/board-directors) (BOD) are hesitant to join the measure—--and might even drop [existing funding for inter-agency coordination](https://mtc.ca.gov/operations/transit-regional-network-management/transit-fare-coordination-integration)! We need huge public pushback to encourage these decision makers—--most of whom don’t use mass transit, period—--to support a well-funded, interconnected transit system around the Bay. 

The original funding proposal was a 1/2 or 1/4 cent sales tax that would hit working people hard AND fail to raise enough revenue to prevent service cuts, given rising inflation and arbitrary tariffs. That's why transit operators and activists are now recommending a [gross receipts tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax) on businesses, a solution which has [61% support from likely voters](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook-pm/2025/06/02/exclusive-transit-unions-launches-effort-to-rework-2026-bay-area-transit-measure-00380857)!

<h4>:warning: Push the SamTrans Board of Directors to join SB 63!</h4>

We have to act fast to prevent the SamTrans BOD from sleepwalking us into the worst-case transit scenario. Making public comments---in person, via Zoom, or by email---at [SamTrans BOD](https://www.samtrans.com/board-of-directors/meetings) meetings is the best way to guarantee airtime for socialist perspectives and directly influence San Mateo County's transit decision makers.

<h3>:rotating_light: Demand Action at the Next BOD Meeting (Wednesday, July 2, 2pm)</h3>

<h4>Practice Your Talking Points</h4>

*  Introduce yourself (name, city, how you use SamTrans)
*  Tell the Board how the proposed service cuts to other Bay Area transit agencies would impact you
*  Ask them to join the regional funding measure (SB 63) and preserve inter-agency coordination
*  Ask them to pursue a gross receipts tax so that corporations pay their fair share!
