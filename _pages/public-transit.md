<h2>San Mateo County: Transit 4 All</h2>

<h3>:rotating_light: Push SamTrans to Support a Progressive Regional Funding Measure</h3>

<h4>:warning: BART & Caltrain are in trouble!</h4>

Did you know [BART](https://www.bart.gov/about/financials/crisis), [Caltrain](https://www.caltrain.com/blog/2023/04/financial-future-caltrain), and [SF Muni](https://www.sfmta.com/project-updates/sfmtas-financial-crisis) are facing "fiscal cliffs" that will force [massive service cuts](https://twitter.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=081245b4dc5f18f3a07fa71e2&id=326a2360be&e=ab29f1143c) if they don't find new funding? The proposed service cuts would mean disaster for transit riders all around the Bay:

* BART: No more night or weekend service!
* Caltrain: Only one local train per hour!
* Muni: Goodbye to cable cars!
* SamTrans: No more free transfers---cutting off San Mateo County from the rest of the Bay Area!

<h4>:warning: SamTrans can help save regional transit...</h4>

Our county’s transit agency, [SamTrans](http://samtrans.com/), has the option to participate in a [proposed regional funding ballot measure](https://mtc.ca.gov/news/commission-eyes-2026-tax-measure-preserve-and-improve-bay-area-transit) (Senators Weiner & Arreguín's [SB 63](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB63)) that--if voters approve it in November 2026--would keep our transit agencies operational.

But some members of the [SamTrans Board of Directors](https://www.samtrans.com/about-samtrans/board-directors) (BOD) are hesitant to join the measure—--and might even drop [existing funding for inter-agency coordination](https://mtc.ca.gov/operations/transit-regional-network-management/transit-fare-coordination-integration)! We need huge public pushback to encourage these folks—--many of whom don’t use mass transit themselves—--to support a well-funded, interconnected transit system around the Bay.

<h4>:warning: We must push the Board of Directors to act!</h4>

Making public comments---in person, via Zoom, or by email---at [SamTrans BOD](https://www.samtrans.com/board-of-directors/meetings) meetings is the best way to guarantee airtime for socialist perspectives and directly influence San Mateo County's transit decision makers. 

We have to act fast to prevent the SamTrans BOD from sleepwalking us into the worst-case scenario.
