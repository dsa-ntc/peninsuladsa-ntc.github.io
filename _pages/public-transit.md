<h2>Meetings</h2>

Making public comments--in person, via Zoom, or by email—-at [SamTrans Board of Directors](https://www.samtrans.com/board-of-directors/meetings) (BOD) meetings is the **best way** to guarantee airtime for socialist perspectives and directly influence San Mateo County's transit decision makers.

<h4>SamTrans BOD Meeting</h4>
**Wednesday, May 7, 2–5pm***

Agenda: https://www.samtrans.com/meetings/2025/05/samtrans-board-directors

<h4>Talking Points</h4>
* Introduce yourself (name, city, how you use SamTrans).
* Tell the BOD how service cuts would impact you
* Ask them to join the regional funding measure (SB 63)
* Ask them to preserve funding for inter-agency coordination
* Ask them to pursue progressive funding solutions, rather than a regressive sales tax that penalizes the working class

<h4>How to Make a Public Comment</h4>
* *In person*: Arrive 10 minutes early to review the agenda and fill out a comment card. Then, wait till the BOD gets to agenda item #5 (general public comment). The secretary will call you to the podium; you have 3 minutes to speak.
* *Virtual*: [Join the Zoom call](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81001317517?pwd=6LuOhomk1KpISW9X2CbpthZRGreaIA.1) and raise your virtual hand immediately once the BOD opens our agenda item #5. The secretary will call your name and unmute you; you have 2 minutes to speak.
