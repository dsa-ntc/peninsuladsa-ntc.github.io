<h2>San Mateo County: Transit 4 All</h2>

<h3> SamTrans Votes to Opt In to Regional Funding Measure (SB 63)!</h3>

GREAT NEWS! Our county‚Äôs transit agency, [SamTrans](http://samtrans.com/), opted to participate in a [five-county regional funding ballot measure](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/03/plan-to-raise-500-million-in-annual-sales-taxes-for-beleaguered-bay-area-transit-advances-in-legislature/) (Senators Weiner & Arregu√≠n's [SB 63](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB63)). If voters approve the measure in November 2026, we'll save our transit agencies AND prevent fossil-fuel emissions by keeping cars off the road.

The original funding proposal for SB 63 was a 1/2 or 1/4 cent sales tax that would hit working people hard AND fail to raise enough revenue to prevent service cuts, given rising inflation and arbitrary tariffs. That's why transit operators and activists are still recommending a [gross receipts tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax) on businesses, a solution which has [61% support from likely voters](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook-pm/2025/06/02/exclusive-transit-unions-launches-effort-to-rework-2026-bay-area-transit-measure-00380857)! A progressive tax of 0.012% on the top 2% of businesses would transform our public transit across the county, but Chair Jeff Gee and Assemblymember Papan appear to be more interested in protecting business interests than in improving service to meet riders' needs.

Thanks for your help, comrades! A better world is possible---if we fight for it.
