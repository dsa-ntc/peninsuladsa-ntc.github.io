Since 2017, Peninsula DSA has been organizing throughout San Mateo County to build working class power for the benefit of the 99%. 
<br>

We are local residents and activists working together in our chapter—and sometimes in coalitions—to build a better world that puts people and planet before profit. Our member-driven organization is made possible by comrades volunteering their labor, according to their ability and their need.
<br>

Whether you're interested in organizing your workplace, winning Medicare for All, building ecosocialism, or learning more about socialism in general, Peninsula DSA is the place to be. **Learn more and get involved [here](../get-involved/).**

<h3>Chapter Leadership</h3>

Our Steering Committee (SC) is elected annually by our membership. Two co-chairs work together on tasks related to Agenda (planning and running meetings), Communications (member and external communications), Finance (chapter funds and filings), and Membership (onboarding and engaging members). The Steering Committee can be reached at the chapter's main email address: **info@peninsuladsa.org**

* **Agenda:** Geoff & Spencer
* **Communications:** Bennet & Raiyan
* **Finance:** Laura & Kier
* **Membership:** Allison & Chet

Our current Steering Committee election was voted in at our chapter convention on Sunday, March 17, 2024; appointments to replace two SC co-chairs were made in December 2024. The next Steering Committee election will take place at our April general meeting on Sunday, April 27, 2025.
