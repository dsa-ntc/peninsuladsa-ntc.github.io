Since 2016, Peninsula DSA has been organizing throughout San Mateo County to build working class power for the benefit of the 99%. 
<br>

Our member-driven organization is made possible by comrades volunteering their labor, each according to their abilities and their need. We are a group of local residents and activists working together—and sometimes also in coalitions—to build a world that puts people and planet before profit.

<h3>Chapter Leadership</h3>

Our Steering Committee (SC) is elected annually by our membership. Two co-chairs work together on tasks related to Agenda (planning and running meetings), Communications (member & external communications), Finance (chapter funds and filings), and Membership (onboarding and engaging members).

* **Agenda:** Gina + open seat
* **Communications:** Sofia & Spencer
* **Finance:** Amanda & Laura
* **Membership:** Allison & Chet

The next SC election will be held at our October chapter meeting. There are currently vacant seats in Agenda and Communications.
