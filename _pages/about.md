Since 2016, Peninsula DSA has been organizing throughout San Mateo County to build working class power for the benefit of the 99%. 
<br>

We are a group of local residents and activists working together—and sometimes in coalitions—to build a world that puts people and planet before profit. Our member-driven organization is made possible by comrades volunteering their labor, each according to their ability and their need.
<br>

Whether you're interested in organizing your workplace, winning Medicare for All, building ecosocialism, or learning more about socialism in general, Peninsula DSA is the place to be. **Learn more and get involved [here](../get-involved/).**

<h3>Chapter Leadership</h3>

Our Steering Committee (SC) is elected annually by our membership. Two co-chairs work together on tasks related to Agenda (planning and running meetings), Communications (member and external communications), Finance (chapter funds and filings), and Membership (onboarding and engaging members).

* **Agenda:** Gina + open seat
* **Communications:** Sofia & Spencer
* **Finance:** Amanda & Laura
* **Membership:** Allison & Chet

Our next Steering Committee election will be at our chapter convention on Sunday, March 17, 4-6pm on Discord.
