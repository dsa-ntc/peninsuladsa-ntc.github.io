Since 2016, Peninsula DSA has been organizing in and around San Mateo County to build working class power for the benefit of the 99%. We are a group of residents working together—and sometimes also in coalitions—to build a better world that puts people before profit. 

Our member-driven organization is made possible by comrades volunteering their labor, each according to their abilities and their need. Learn more and get involved [here](../get-involved/).

<h3>Chapter Leadership</h3>

Our Steering Committee (SC) is elected annually by our membership. Two co-chairs work together on tasks related to Agenda (planning and running meetings), Communications (member & external communications), Finance (chapter funds and filings), and Membership (onboarding and engaging members).

* **Agenda:** Gina & Todd
* **Communications:** Bennet & Spencer
* **Finance:** Amanda & Laura
* **Membership:** Allison & Chet

The next SC election will be held at our October chapter meeting. There are currently vacant seats in Agenda and Communications.
