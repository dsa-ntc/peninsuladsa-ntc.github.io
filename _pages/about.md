<h4>Since 2017, Peninsula DSA has been organizing to build working class power to benefit the 99%.</h4> 

<h3>Who We Are</h3>

We are San Mateo County residents and activists working together in our local DSA chapter—and sometimes in coalitions—to build a better world that puts people and planet before profit. Our member-driven organization is made possible by comrades volunteering their labor, from each according to their ability.

Peninsula DSA is the place to be if you're interested in 
- organizing your workplace (we recommend [contacting EWOC!](https://workerorganizing.org/)),
- winning Medicare for All (once we _first_ win [CNA's CalCare](https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/calcare)),
- building ecosocialism (check out our [Transit 4 All campaign](https://peninsuladsa.org/public-transit/) and [Reclaim Our Power](https://reclaimourpowerca.org/)'s campaign to municipalize PG&E),
- joining electoral campaigns for DSA candidates (such as South City's [James Coleman](https://www.ssf.net/Departments/City-Council/Meet-the-City-Council/James-Coleman))
- canvassing for citizens' ballot intiatives (such as our [2022 universal preschool campaign in SSF](https://peninsuladsa.org/preschool-for-all/) and the [2026 campaign for housing justice in RWC](https://peninsuladsa.org/housing/), or
- learning more about socialism in general (join our [political reading group](https://peninsuladsa.org/political-reading/)!)
