**We are the Peninsula chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)**. Democratic socialists believe both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for the wealthy. Throughout the area of San Mateo County, California, our chapter fights for the good of the many, not the few.
