<h4>Peninsula DSA demands free, high-quality universal preschool and childcare, and a living wage for our preschool teachers and childcare workers.</h4>

After Measure DD's narrow loss at the ballot box in November 2022--largely because **Big Biotech spent more than $500,000 to stop us**--Peninsula DSA is considering our next steps. South San Francisco preschool teachers, childcare providers, labor organizers, and Measure DD supporters are invited to contact our Steering Committee ([info@peninsuladsa.org](mailto:info@peninsuladsa.org)) to discuss the campaign and to share ideas for future efforts to win Preschool for All SSF.

<h2>Preschool for All SSF (Yes on Measure DD)</h2>

Peninsula DSA’s Preschool for All working group spent two years organizing for the success of the DSA-endorsed Preschool for All South San Francisco campaign / **Yes on Measure DD** (see historic [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yesonddssf/) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yesonddssf/) pages), which would
1. fully fund high-quality preschool to all children aged 2.5 to 5 years old whose families live or work in South City,
2. provide a living wage to all early care and education (ECE) workers, and 
3. pay for it all by levying a modest parcel tax on South City's largest commercial office properties.
