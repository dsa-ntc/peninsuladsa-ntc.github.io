<h2>Preschool for All SSF (Yes on Measure DD)</h2>

Peninsula DSAâ€™s Preschool for All working group is organizing for the success of the DSA-endorsed Preschool for All South San Francisco campaign / [Yes on Measure DD](http://ece4allssf.org/), which will
1. fully fund high-quality preschool to all children aged 2.5 to 5 years old whose families live or work in South City,
2. provide a living wage to all early care and education (ECE) workers, and 
3. pay for it all by levying a modest parcel tax on South City's largest commercial office properties.
