After Measure DD's narrow loss at the ballot box in November 2022--largely because Big Biotech spent $500,000+ to stop us--Peninsula DSA is considering our next steps. South San Francisco preschool teachers, childcare providers, labor organizers, and Measure DD supporters are invited to contact our Steering Committee ([info@peninsuladsa.org](mailto:info@peninsuladsa.org)) to discuss the campaign and to share ideas re: future efforts to win Preschool for All SSF.

<h1>Past Campaign</h1>

<h2>Preschool for All SSF (Yes on Measure DD)</h2>

Peninsula DSAâ€™s Preschool for All working group spent two years organizing for the success of the DSA-endorsed Preschool for All South San Francisco campaign / [Yes on Measure DD](http://ece4allssf.org/), which would
1. fully fund high-quality preschool to all children aged 2.5 to 5 years old whose families live or work in South City,
2. provide a living wage to all early care and education (ECE) workers, and 
3. pay for it all by levying a modest parcel tax on South City's largest commercial office properties.
