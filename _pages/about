We are a group of residents of the SF Peninsula working together to build a world that puts people before profit. Since 2016, PDSA has been organizing locally to build working class power, to the benefit of the 99%. Our member-driven organization is made possible by comrades volunteering their labor and cash, each according to their abilities and their need. Learn more and get involved [here](../get-involved/).

<h3>Chapter Leadership</h3>

Our Steering Committee (SC) is elected annually by our membership. Two co-chairs work together on tasks related to Agenda (planning and running meetings), Communications (member & external communications), Finance (chapter funds and filings), and Membership (onboarding and engaging members).

* Agenda co-chairs: Gina & Todd
* Communications co-chairs: Bennet & Spencer
* Finance co-chairs: Amanda & Laura
* Membership co-chairs: Allison & Chet

The next SC election will be held at our October chapter meeting. There are currently vacant seats in Agenda and Communications.
