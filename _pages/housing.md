At our most recent chapter convention (March 2023), PDSA members voted to endorse and provide material support to [Faith in Action Bay Area](https://faithinactionba.org/)â€™s [Affordable Redwood City](https://www.affordableredwoodcity.com/) housing campaign to win rent control and tenant protections. 

Because this is a citizens' ballot measure campaign, a simple majority (50%) of voters can pass the measure into law in the November 2026 election, keeping Redwood City affordable, diverse, and vibrant - with no more unjustified rent hikes and unfair evictions!

As confirmed with FiABA, PDSA will support the campaign by

1. joining their mobilizations to gather signatures (through June 2026),
2. canvassing Redwood City voters (June to November 2026),
3. phone banking voters (June to November 2026), and 
4. staffing special campaign events as needed.
