**Workers of the world, unite!** Peninsula DSA helps build labor power at the local level by joining picket lines, contributing to strike funds, and pointing non-unionized workers to the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee](https://workerorganizing.org/). We'll also be preparing for [UAW's proposed general strike](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/may-1st-2028) on International Workers Day, May 1, 2028. Stay up-to-date by joining #labor on our Discord!

<h3>Current Campaign</h3>
Peninsula DSA is developing a transit-oriented campaign in solidarity with unionized [SamTrans](https://www.samtrans.com/) workers and working-class commuters in San Mateo County. Our campaign proposal was chosen as a chapter priority at our chapter convention on March 17, 2024. We're currently organizing within [Transbay Coalition](https://www.transbaycoalition.org/)'s network of transit organizations and activists. Check the [events calendar](https://peninsuladsa.org/calendar/) for the details of our next meeting.
