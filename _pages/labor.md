Workers of the world, unite! Peninsula DSA helps build labor power by joining picket lines, contributing to strike funds, and pointing non-unionized workers to the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee](https://workerorganizing.org/). Stay up to date by joining #labor on our Discord!

<h3>Current Campaign</h3>
The newly re-formed Labor working group is developing a transit-oriented campaign in solidarity with unionized [SamTrans](https://www.samtrans.com/) workers and working-class commuters in San Mateo County. Vote for our campaign proposal at the Peninsula DSA chapter convention on Sunday, March 17, 4-6pm!
