[![Want to get involved with Peninsula DSA? Join us!](/assets/images/getinvolved.png){:class="img-responsive}](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/dsa_recommit_2022/)

<h2>Join DSA!</h2>

The [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/) is the largest socialist organization in the United States because weâ€™re a member-driven mass organization. We are a political and activist organization, not a party. We believe that working people should run both the economy and civil society, and we show our commitment to this principle by being an organization of, by, and for the working class.

[Join DSA](https://www.dsausa.org/join) today, and Peninsula DSA's Membership co-chairs will get you started (and invite you to the PDSA Slack). 

And please [subscribe to our email list](http://eepurl.com/cNwNHH) to stay up to date on PDSA news and events!

<h2>Events</h2>

Check out Peninsula DSA's complete [event calendar](../calendar) (or #events on Slack) for all confirmed virtual and in-person events.

<h2>Working Groups</h2>

Peninsula DSA's working groups organize socialist campaigns around issues that matter to the working class. Whether you're an experienced organizer or brand-new to the movement, you're welcome to attend any meeting to learn more--and get involved!

<h3>Preschool for All</h3>
Our [Preschool for All](../preschool-for-all/) working group is organizing a broad working-class grassroots coalition for [Yes on Measure DD](http://ece4allssf.org/), a popular, DSA-endorsed electoral campaign to create universal preschool for every child aged 2.5 to 5yo whose parents live or work in South San Francisco.
