[![Want to get involved with Peninsula DSA? Join us!](/assets/images/getinvolved.png){:class="img-responsive}](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/dsa_recommit_2022/)

<h2>Join DSA!</h2>

The [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/) is the largest socialist organization in the United States because weâ€™re a member-driven mass organization. We believe that working people should run both the economy and civil society, and we show our commitment to this principle by being an organization of, by, and for the working class. 

[Join](https://www.dsausa.org/join) DSA today, and Peninsula DSA's Membership co-chairs will get you started (and invite you to the PDSA Slack).

<h2>Peninsula DSA Events</h2>

<h3>Calendar</h3>

<h3>Chapter Meetings</h3>
Peninsula DSA meets virtually on the third Sunday of the month at 4-6pm.
