<h4>Across San Mateo County, your comrades are building power to take on the capitalist class. Are you in?</h4>

<h2>Join DSA!</h2>

**A better world is possible:** You don't have to settle for a half life under the boot of fascist oligarchy! 

The [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/) (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States because we’re a member-driven mass movement, not a donor-managed party or nonprofit. 

As a political and activist organization, **we believe that workers should run both the economy and civil society**. We show our commitment to this democratic principle by being an organization of, by, and for the working class. 

After all, the people have the labor power--and the know-how--to build a shared future where everyone can
* [Live in dignified social housing](https://www.dsausa.org/dsa-political-platform-from-2021-convention/#housing), 
* Access free healthcare through [Medicare for All](https://www.dsausa.org/dsa-political-platform-from-2021-convention/#health), and
* Enjoy a full lifespan on a livable planet, thanks to the [Green New Deal](https://www.dsausa.org/dsa-political-platform-from-2021-convention/#gnd)!

[![Want to get involved with Peninsula DSA? Join us!](/assets/images/getinvolved.png){:class="img-responsive}](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/)

Since its founding in 2017, Peninsula DSA has been run by comrades volunteering their time, skills, and dollars to the cause of collective liberation. When you [join our chapter](https://www.dsausa.org/join), our Membership co-chairs will connect you to our local organizing work and invite you to the PDSA Discord server, our virtual HQ for coordinating between meetings and events.

<h2>Meet Your Comrades!</h2>

Whether you join us in person or online, we look forward to organizing with you! Peninsula DSA's confirmed meetings and social events--plus community meetings and more--can all be found on our 
* official [**event calendar**](../calendar),
* PDSA's private **Discord server**, and
* in our **monthly e-newsletter** ([subscribe here](http://eepurl.com/cNwNHH)!).

<h3>:rose: General Meetings</h3>

Our chapter's monthly general meetings, usually held on 3rd Sundays at 4-6pm, are key to coordinating our organizing efforts. We host presentations on socialist topics, hold democratic discussions (and vote!) on chapter priorities, and always share updates from our Steering Committee and working groups. If you're a chapter member, attending general meetings is the best way to stay engaged and up-to-date!
* _Chapter meetings are usually held virtually on the **PDSA Discord: #general**._

<h3>:rose: Reading Group</h3>

The people who came before us have a lot to teach us! Our political [reading group](../political-reading/) meets at least once a month to discuss socialist books and articles democratically chosen by participants. We read everything from Karl Marx to Malcolm Harris.
* _Read more [here](../political-reading/) or on the **PDSA Discord: #reading-group**_.

<h3>:rose: Working Groups</h3>

Our working groups organize socialist campaigns and/or join coalitions around issues that empower the working class. They each have their own leadership structure and meeting schedule.

<h4>:station: PRIORITY CAMPAIGN: Public Transit</h4>
With a mandate from PDSA's 2024 convention, Peninsula DSA is developing our own Transit 4 All campaign in coalition with our friends at [Transbay Coalition](https://www.transbaycoalition.org/).

* _Read more [here](../public-transit/) and join your public transit-loving comrades on the **PDSA Discord: #transit**_

<h4>:earth_africa: Ecosocialism</h4>
Our [Ecosocialism](../ecosocialism/) working group continues to organize for building energy justice and holding PG&E accountable for its dirty, dangerous, and unreliable fossil-fuel energy. We have run workshops on making DIY air purifiers to protect against wildfire smoke and airborne pathogens, and have distributed money-saving energy efficiency tips to renters.

<h4>:hospital: Healthcare Justice</h4>
Our [Healthcare Justice](../healthcare-justice/) working group continues to organize for Medicare for All. We endorse and support the California Nurses Association's (CNA) statewide universal healthcare campaign, [CalCare](https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/calcare).  Though AB 1690 and then AB 2200 didn't make it to the floor of the California legislature, Guaranteed Healthcare for All bill will be back again soon—and we'll be there to fight for it.

<h3>:rose: Social Events</h3>

>I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from convention and prejudice, should demand the denial of life and joy. <br>
-- Emma Goldman, _Living My Life_ (1931)

<h4>First Fridays: Socialize with Socialists!</h4>
Come join your comrades after work to talk about socialism!  Each month, we alternate between bayside and coastside locations, and usually pick a venue (with outdoor seating) where under 21s are welcome.

* _Please check the [event calendar](../calendar) for confirmed dates and locations._

<h4>Play & Praxis: Socialist Game Night!</h4>
Defy capitalist productivity by engaging in revolutionary play! Our socialist game nights create space to practice agency and imagine a collective, liberated future through cooperative games. Favorites have included [Strike! The Game of Worker Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnrHK85kcnk) and [Co-opoly](https://store.tesacollective.com/products/co-opoly-the-game-of-co-operatives) (both designed by the worker-owned cooperative [TESA Collective](https://www.tesacollective.com/)). We've also played [Bloc by Bloc: Uprising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR85Umxxb6I) and [The Resistance](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance).
