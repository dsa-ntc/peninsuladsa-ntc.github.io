[![Want to get involved with Peninsula DSA? Join us!](/assets/images/getinvolved.png){:class="img-responsive}](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/dsa_recommit_2022/)

<h2>Join DSA!</h2>

The [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/) is the largest socialist organization in the United States because weâ€™re a member-driven mass organization. We believe that working people should run both the economy and civil society, and we show our commitment to this principle by being an organization of, by, and for the working class. 

[Join DSA today](https://www.dsausa.org/join), and Peninsula DSAs Membership co-chairs will get you started with the chapter!

<h2>Events</h2>

Join your comrades at an upcoming Peninsula DSA chapter meeting, canvassing turnout, socialist game night, and more!

<h2>Working Groups</h2>

Peninsula DSA's working groups organize socialist campaigns around single issues that matter to the working class. Whether you're an experienced organizer or brand-new to the movement, you're welcome to attend any working group meeting to learn more--and get involved!

<h3>Preschool for All</h3>
Our [Preschool for All working group](../preschool-for-all/) is organizing with a broad working-class grassroots coalition on [Yes on Measure DD](http://ece4allssf.org/), a popular, DSA-endorsed electoral campaign to create universal preschool for every child aged 2.5 to 5yo whose parents live or work in South San Francisco. (On the PDSA Slack as #wg-universal-pre-k)

<h3>Healthcare Justice</h3>
Our [Healthcare Justice working group](../healthcare-justice/) continues to organize for Medicare for All. (On the PDSA Slack as #wg-healthcare)

<h3>Ecosocialism</h3>
Our [Ecosocialism working group](../ecosocialism/) continues to organize for energy justice by holding PG&E accountable for its dirty, dangerous, and unreliable fossil-fuel energy. (On the PDSA Slack as #wg-ecosocialism)

<h2>Reading Group</h2>

Our [political reading group](../political-reading/) meets at least once a month to discuss socialist books and articles democratically chosen by participants. (On the PDSA Slack as #reading-group)
