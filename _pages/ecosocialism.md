<h3>Current Campaign</h3>
The Ecosocialism working group continues to work for energy justice by supporting the [Reclaim Our Power!](https://reclaimourpowerca.org/) campaign to hold investor-owned utility PG&E accountable for its refusal to upgrade its dirty, dangerous, and unreliable energy system. Our members call into public meetings of the California Public Utilities Committee (CPUC) to protest their ongoing complicity in unaccountable monopoly power.

<h3>Meetings</h3>
As needed, usually Saturdays at 6pm
