<h4>Abolish Rent: How Tenants Can End the Housing Crisis</h4>

<img src="https://peninsuladsa.org/assets/images/Abolish Rent cover.jpg" align="right" height="" width="40%">

[_Abolish Rent_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/abolish-rent-how-tenants-can-end-the-housing-crisis-leonardo-vilchis/c1901b8e26387cf4?ean=9798888902523&next=t) takes aim at one of the foremost engines of inequality and injustice.

Rent drives millions into debt, despair, and onto the streets. The social cost of rent is too damn high. Written for anyone fed up with the permanent housing crisis, complicit politicians, and real estate greed, _Abolish Rent_ dissects our housing system from the perspective of those it immiserates. Through unsparing analysis and striking stories of resistance, it shows us how tenants can, through organizing and collective action, harness our power and win the housing we deserve.

From two co-founders of the largest tenants union in the country, this deeply reported account of the resurgent tenant movement centers poor and working-class people who are fighting back, staying put, and remaking the city in the process. Authors Tracy Rosenthal and Leonardo Vilchis take us to trilingual strategy meetings, raucous marches against gentrification, and daring eviction defenses where immigrants put their lives on the line. These are the seeds of the revolutionary movement we need to make our housing, our cities, and the world our home.
