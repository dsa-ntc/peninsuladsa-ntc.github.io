Peninsula DSA engages in ongoing political education in socialist history and thought because theory informs praxis. 
<br>

Come join our next virtual reading group on Sunday, March 5, at 7pm! We'll discuss "The Trials and Tribulations of National Consciousness," the third essay of Fanon's _The Wretched of the Earth_. See the Peninsula DSA [calendar](../calendar/) for log-in credentials. (Also on the PDSA Slack at #reading-group)
