* [ABCs of Socialism](https://archive.org/details/abcs-of-socialism/mode/1up?view=theater) by [Jacobin](https://jacobin.com/) + [Verso](https://www.versobooks.com/).

**Thursday, February 27, 2025, 7-8pm:** On the Peninsula DSA Discord, we'll cover selected readings from the essay collection [*The ABCs of Socialism*](https://s3.jacobinmag.com/issues/jacobin-abcs.pdf). Though you're encouraged to cover the whole pamphlet, we'll cover:
- Will socialists take my Kenny Loggins records? 
- Is socialism a Western concept? 
- What about racism? Don't socialists only care about class? 
- Aren't socialism and feminism sometimes in conflict? 
- Wouldn't a more democratic world just mean a bigger environmental crisis?

**Wednesday January 29, 2025, 7pm:** We discussed the following topics:
- Isn't America already kind of socialist?
- But at least capitalism is free and democratic, right?
- Socialism sounds good in theory, but doesn’t human nature make it impossible to realize?
- Don’t the rich deserve to keep most of their money?
- Doesn't socialism always end up in dictatorship?
