**What to expect:** Peninsula DSA's multi-week reading group for _What's Left_ will kick off with comradely icebreakers followed by an open-ended discussion of the book's _Introduction_. We have until the bookshop closes at 8pm—but even then, we might keep the conversation going at a restaurant downtown.

Please consider ordering your copy of _What's Left_ from our friendly hosts, [Fireside Books & More](https://firesiderwc.com/), by visiting their [Bookshop.org storefront](https://bookshop.org/shop/FiresideRWC) or emailing orders[at]firesiderwc.com
