Peninsula DSA’s Healthcare Justice working group is committed to bringing about universal healthcare through Medicare for All. CA Assemblymember Ash Kalra (D-San Jose), with the backing of the [California Nurses Association](https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/california-nurses-association) (CNA), has reintroduced the new and improved CalCare bill: [AB 2200: Guaranteed Healthcare for All](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB2200/id/2919344). Come join the Healthcare Justice working group as we determine how best to help pass this life-saving legislation!
