Peninsula DSA’s Healthcare Justice working group is committed to bringing about universal healthcare through Medicare for All. Now that the California State Assembly has decided against bringing AB 1400 (CalCare) to a vote, a clear legislative path to M4A no longer exists. Come join the Healthcare Justice working group as we determine our new direction.
