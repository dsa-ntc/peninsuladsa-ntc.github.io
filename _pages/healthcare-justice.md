Peninsula DSA’s Healthcare Justice working group is committed to bringing about universal healthcare through Medicare for All. Though the California State Assembly decided against bringing AB 1400 (CalCare) to a vote in 2022, the California Nurses Association (CNA) is [organizing](https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/calcare) to bring it back in 2024. Come join the Healthcare Justice working group as we determine how best to help!
