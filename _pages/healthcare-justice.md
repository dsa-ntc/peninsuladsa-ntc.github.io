Peninsula DSA’s Healthcare Justice working group is committed to bringing about free, comprehensive, universal healthcare to all residents nationally through [Medicare for All](https://medicare4all.org/), and at the state level through [CalCare](https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/calcare). 

Naturally, unionized healthcare workers are leading the effort to put patients over profits by ending for-profit healthcare and insurance. The [California Nurses Association (CNA)](https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/california-nurses-association) (CNA) has supported CA Assemblymember Ash Kalra (D-San Jose) in introducing CalCare twice now, in 2021-22 as AB 1400 and in 2023-24 as [AB 2200: Guaranteed Healthcare for All](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB2200/id/2919344). We're looking to CNA for guidance on how to organize for future CalCare legislation.
